  <p><h1>Please read the instructions below.</h1></p>
  <p>During this experiment you will learn to use Graspable math to preform mathematical operations on expressions and equations.
    After a short tutorial please follow the instructions as they appear on the screen to perform the operation.
    You will be asked to perform such tasks as commuting (moving) the terms within an expression, adding terms in succession (referred to as ‘smooshing’),
    and multiply or divide within an expression or across an equation.</p>
  <p>During these tasks you will notice that some of the problems are interactive
    and will react as you make movements and some will not. Please perform each of these task to the best of your ability with this in mind.</p>
