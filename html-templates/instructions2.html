  <p><b>You completed the tutorial!</b>

  <p>For the next 15 minutes or so, you will see mathematical expressions on the screen.
  Each expression comes with instructions of what to do, such as commuting terms.

  <p>There are two conditions.
  In the <i>interactive condition</i>, dragging or clicking terms will actually trigger an
  action, as in the tutorial. In the <i>static condition</i>, dragging or clicking terms will not trigger
  actions. In both cases, please drag or click the way that best follows the instructions.
