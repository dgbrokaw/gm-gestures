<p><b>Great, you finished the experiment!</b>

<p>In the main part of this experiment you used Graspable Math, an interactive algebra notation system.
By looking at the places you clicked and dragged we hope to make Graspable Math more intuitive
and easy to use. This way, Graspable Math becomes a more useful tool both for math education and cognitive
research!

<p>
We greatly appreciate your help! If you have questions or concerns about participating in this study,
please feel free to ask us.
